title: Week 7.5 -- Spring Break
---

This week was spring break, so we didn't have class on Monday or Wednesday.  I spent the week mostly just enjoying my spring break by hanging out with friends and playing basketball.  However, towards the end of the break, my town shut down all public parks and started encouraging social distancing.  Thus, I started playing video games and watching YouTube to entertain myself.  As for open source contributions I made this week, I did take a look at other students' week 7 blog posts to see if there were any typos.  Of the ones that did have them, I raised an issue to the respective Github account and added the raised issue to my contributions file.  I also began to think about the ways in which I want to contribute to the group open source project.  With so many things I'm interested in, I want to try and dial it down to just a few ideas so I don't spread myself too wide.  Currently I'm thinking of contributing sprites/graphics, and some storyline functions through Python.
